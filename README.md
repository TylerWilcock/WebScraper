<h1> WebScraper (Super original name) </h1>
The goal of this project is to scrape words off random (or not random) webpages and display them in nice looking graphs in reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful style.  The idea for this project just came to me one day, and while not entirely useful, could end up looking pretty cool with the added benefit of learning some new things along the way.
