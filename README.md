<h1> Wiki Scraper </h1>
The goal of this project is to scrape words off random (or not random) Wikipedia pages and display them in nice looking graphs in reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful style.  The idea for this project just came to me one day, and while not entirely useful, could end up looking pretty cool and I hope to learn several things along the way.
